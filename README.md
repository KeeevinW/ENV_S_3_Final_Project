# ENV S 3 Final Project
This website serves as my 2025 Winter ENV S 3 final project. Below is my proposal for this project. Here is the [website](https://keeevinw.github.io/).

## Project Proposal
My final project will be an artistic project. As a golfer and a computer science student, I plan to build a website about the impact golf courses have on the natural environment, both negatively and positively. Specifically, the negative side includes habitat destruction, the use of chemicals, soil erosion, etc., while the positive side includes green spaces, water filtration, etc. I will also provide my solution to resolve the negative impacts, such as promoting eco-friendly management. I will also list golf courses that have done well in terms of environmental protection. The Sandpiper Golf Course next to UCSB could also be a good example because you can actually see sandpipers on the course. By doing so, I aim to use my expertise to raise awareness and encourage more sustainable practices in the golfing industry.

## How to Run it
To deploy this website, rename the repository to KeeevinW.github.io
